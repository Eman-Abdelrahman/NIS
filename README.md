# Capitalization does not matter for a character, but characters should be output in the same form that they were input.  e.g. P should count the same as p, but be output as P.  Non-alphabetic characters should be ignored and not included in the output string.

# “VirginiaTech” would be output as “aceghiiinrTV”
# “3 Blind Mice” would be output as “BcdeiilMn"
