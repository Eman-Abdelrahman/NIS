# Alphabetizer: A program that can read in a series of strings and output the strings with the characters in alphabetical order. 
## Usage guide
### From the command Line:
- [ ] Navigate to the src folder in:
    - [ ] To build: javac alphabetizer/alphabetizer.java 
    - [ ] To run: java alphabetizer.Alphabetizer <inputFileName.txt> <outputFileName.txt>
    
### Capitalization does not matter for a character, but characters should be output in the same form that they were input.  e.g. P should count the same as p, but be output as P.  Non-alphabetic characters should be ignored and not included in the output string.
### Examples: 
### “VirginiaTech” would be output as “aceghiiinrTV”
### “3 Blind Mice” would be output as “BcdeiilMn"

 
### N.B: This approach is assuming that the order of uppercase and lowercase doesn't matter ex.: Vv is the same as vV --> they both will be alphabetized to Vv
